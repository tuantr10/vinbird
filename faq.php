                <h3>WHAT IS EDIBLE BIRD’S NEST?</h3>
                Edible bird’s nests are created by cave swiftlets (Collocalia fuciphaga) using solidified saliva, which are harvested for human consumption. The nests have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years, most often as bird's nest soup.
